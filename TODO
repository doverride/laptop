* new "fs" to set up for labeling: nsfs

* appropriately name: audit_test_for_journald() journal_test_for_systemd()

* is there a pattern that all nsswitch client subjects want to read machine runtime files?

* test all the systemd "ctl" apps (as staff_t) by commenting out systemctl_client_subject_type first because that provides a lot of permissions that all have in common.

* do journal clients still need net_admin?

* fix all nested optionals (dont nest them) i already did the roles, need to do the remainder
    cil handles this differently: if a nested optional is disabled, then so is its parent; i had to find out the hard way.)

    nested optionals do not make sense any way. if you use optionals properly.

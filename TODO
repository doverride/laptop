* appropriately name: audit_test_for_journald()

* pa depends on dbus , so everything that makes a sound (all pa_client()) depends on dbus (needs to be nested inside pa optional)

    so globally you have two kinds:

        apps that depend on xserver and pa:

        xserver (
            pa (
                app(
                )
            )
        )

        apps that depend on pa:

        pa (
            app (
            )
        )

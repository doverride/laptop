* is there a pattern that all nsswitch client subjects want to read machine runtime files?

* implement system_map_t for /boot/System.map.* files?

* vlock

* add systemd units and admins for various systemd daemons i neglected: machine, locale, hostname etc
    the ones that have a ctl app as well as a service unit

* work on localectl loginctl timedatectl hostnamectl

* cover /usr/lib/systemd/system/cpupower.service debug-shell.service dnsmasq

* give /run/systemd/private a private type (/run/user/UID/systemd/private is already done)

    (implies also revisiting journal_client_subject_type (and other systemd_stream_connect/ systemd_dgram_send calls)  once again
    since it calls systemd_write_systemd_runtime_sock_files either for notify or private sock file)

* systemd-notify can be run by system and session scripts (its an applications app) : there are some neat examples in man systemd-notify to test it

* enable man-db timer on e145

* vlock

* add systemd units and admins for various systemd daemons i neglected: machine, locale, hostname etc
    the ones that have a ctl app as well as a service unit

* work on localectl loginctl timedatectl hostnamectl

* cover debug-shell.service

* Test it: systemd-notify can be run by system and session scripts (its an applications app) : there are some neat examples in man systemd-notify to test it

* figure out what /run/systemd/inaccessible is for and associate it with a private type

* target crypto-policies

* Due to a "bug/limitation" in the processing of constraints ubac.cil depends on staff.cil and sysadm.cil which depend on usersubject.cil
    - Remove that dependency if/when that "bug/limitation" in the processing of constraints is lifted
    - Fix the tests accordingly

* I should dontaudit attempts to get attributes of user terminals on applications_subject_type level rather than for each individual application subject
    The problem is that when some app really needs it, it would probably be harder to identify, that is why for now i add these on an individual basis

    not just that but eventually i would probably need to add (devices_dontaudit_catchall_subject_type (applications_subject_type)), and that would
    hide even more potentially critical access attempts.

    Keep it like this for a while work out on individual basis, once i dont see these attempts any more, and things are still stable, then i can move it to
        applications.cil

* on e145 edit nf(6)?tables.service:  Before=network.target

* unconfined.cil: grant access to policy_conf_t, audisp_conf_t, auditd_conf_t, auditd_log_t

* dbus/dbususer ~/.local/share/dbus-1/services

* new "fs" to set up for labeling: nsfs

* appropriately name: audit_test_for_journald() journal_test_for_systemd()

* is there a pattern that all nsswitch client subjects want to read machine runtime files?

* test all the systemd "ctl" apps (as staff_t) by commenting out systemctl_client_subject_type first because that provides a lot of permissions that all have in common.

* do journal clients still need net_admin?

* there might be some redundant net_admins' in there because journal_client_subject_type also has it.

* review pretty much all net_admins everywhere. in a lot of instances it is not really needed.

* implement system_map_t for /boot/System.map.* files?

* firewalld i suppose..., work on qemuga for guests

* edit contexts/openssh_contexts to reflect the sshd_net_t privset preauth type 
    also fix contexts/users/{staff_u,sysadm_u}

* think about support for systemd network socket activated subjects (sshd -> tcp_socket -> 22)
    would probably want to be specific about that but not sure how to implement that:

    (call systemd_tcp_socket_activated_subject_type (sshd_t))
    (call systemd_tcp_socket_activated_object_type (ssh_port_t))

    (allow systemd_t systemd_tcp_socket_activated_subject_type create_tcp_stream_socket_perms)
    (allow systemd_t systemd_tcp_socket_activated_object_type (tcp_socket (name_bind)))

    or maybe unspecific, and allow systemd to bind tcp/udp sockets to all ports conditionally...

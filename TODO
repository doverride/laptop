* new "fs" to set up for labeling: nsfs

* appropriately name: audit_test_for_journald() journal_test_for_systemd()

* is there a pattern that all nsswitch client subjects want to read machine runtime files?

* test all the systemd "ctl" apps (as staff_t) by commenting out systemctl_client_subject_type first because that provides a lot of permissions that all have in common.

* do journal clients still need net_admin?

* there might be some redundant net_admins' in there because journal_client_subject_type also has it.

* i allowed mplayer_t execmem but that is probably due to an xserver bug.. remove it once xserver becomes a bit more stable

* implement system_map_t for /boot/System.map.* files?

* make /etc/ls.so.config ld_config_t? maybe even mode ld.so.cache to ld.cil?

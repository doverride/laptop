* appropriately name: audit_test_for_journald() journal_test_for_systemd()

* is there a pattern that all nsswitch client subjects want to read machine runtime files?

* test all the systemd "ctl" apps (as staff_t) by commenting out systemctl_client_subject_type first because that provides a lot of permissions that all have in common.
* do journal clients still need net_admin?

* new "fs" to set up for labeling: nsfs

* appropriately name: audit_test_for_journald() journal_test_for_systemd()

* is there a pattern that all nsswitch client subjects want to read machine runtime files?

* test all the systemd "ctl" apps (as staff_t) by commenting out systemctl_client_subject_type first because that provides a lot of permissions that all have in common.
* do journal clients still need net_admin?

* all journal client subject types need to write to kmsg_dev_t in case shit hits the fan

* think about a solution for confined systemd session daemons (/lib/systemd/user/emacs.service /lib/systemd/user/obexd.service)

* appropriately name: audit_test_for_journald() journal_test_for_systemd()

* is there a pattern that all nsswitch client subjects want to read machine runtime files?

* do journal clients still need net_admin?

* implement system_map_t for /boot/System.map.* files?

* firewalld i suppose, vlock

* think about support for systemd network socket activated subjects (sshd -> tcp_socket -> 22)
    would probably want to be specific about that but not sure how to implement that:

    (call systemd_tcp_socket_activated_subject_type (sshd_t))
    (call systemd_tcp_socket_activated_object_type (ssh_port_t))

    (allow systemd_t systemd_tcp_socket_activated_subject_type create_tcp_stream_socket_perms)
    (allow systemd_t systemd_tcp_socket_activated_object_type (tcp_socket (name_bind)))

    or maybe unspecific, and allow systemd to bind tcp/udp sockets to all ports conditionally...

* i should be able to shave off some nspawn_common_container_subject_type self permissions
    for example there is no audit, and no selinux either in the container.

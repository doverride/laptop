* new "fs" to set up for labeling: nsfs

* appropriately name: audit_test_for_journald() journal_test_for_systemd()

* is there a pattern that all nsswitch client subjects want to read machine runtime files?

* test all the systemd "ctl" apps (as staff_t) by commenting out systemctl_client_subject_type first because that provides a lot of permissions that all have in common.

* do journal clients still need net_admin?

* target bootchart

* decouple unconfineduser from unconfined so that unconfineduser can depend on usersubject but unconfined does not depend on unconfineduser

* systemd indirectly depends on usersubject one way or another via auth.
    if i were to strip auth_nsswitch_client_subject and utmp related from auth then i might be able to get rid of the systemd usersubject dependency.

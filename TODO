* is there a pattern that all nsswitch client subjects want to read machine runtime files?

* implement system_map_t for /boot/System.map.* files?

* vlock

* think about support for systemd network socket activated subjects (sshd -> tcp_socket -> 22)
    would probably want to be specific about that but not sure how to implement that:

    (call systemd_tcp_socket_activated_subject_type (sshd_t))
    (call systemd_tcp_socket_activated_object_type (ssh_port_t))

    (allow systemd_t systemd_tcp_socket_activated_subject_type create_tcp_stream_socket_perms)
    (allow systemd_t systemd_tcp_socket_activated_object_type (tcp_socket (name_bind)))

    or maybe unspecific, and allow systemd to bind tcp/udp sockets to all ports conditionally...

* add systemd units and admins for various systemd daemons i neglected: machine, locale, hostname etc
    the ones that have a ctl app as well as a service unit

* work on localectl loginctl timedatectl hostnamectl

* vlock runuser su

* add systemd units and admins for various systemd daemons i neglected: machine, locale, hostname etc
    the ones that have a ctl app as well as a service unit

* work on localectl loginctl timedatectl hostnamectl

* cover debug-shell.service

* Test it: systemd-notify can be run by system and session scripts (its an applications app) : there are some neat examples in man systemd-notify to test it

* figure out what /run/systemd/inaccessible is for and associate it with a private type

* target crypto-policies

* Due to a "bug/limitation" in the processing of constraints ubac.cil depends on staff.cil and sysadm.cil which depend on usersubject.cil
    - Remove that dependency if/when that "bug/limitation" in the processing of constraints is lifted
    - Fix the tests accordingly

* dbus/dbususer ~/.local/share/dbus-1/services

* unconfined users currently get all HOME_DIR file contexts specs just like any other user (except root)
    should probably find a way to only add specs for those users that apply to them: home_dir_t, user_home_t, config_home_t, cache_home_t, data_home_t, ssh_home_t,
        systemd_config_home_t

    it does not really matter though since the user is unconfined anyways but it would be a little cleaner

    The problem would be that i would need to add more logic on how to determine which seuser is unconfined and which contexts to add and which not

* rw_fifo_file_perms should probably be part of ns_client_subject_type

* d30: rpmfusion: mplayer .. deps

* e145: add IPForward=yes to ve-mycontainer.network/$EXTERNAL_NETWORK_IF.network (forwarding needs to be enabled for those networks)
* e145: fix ipfwd_by_mac: see ipfwd_by_mac for x131e

* new "fs" to set up for labeling: nsfs

* appropriately name: audit_test_for_journald() journal_test_for_systemd()

* is there a pattern that all nsswitch client subjects want to read machine runtime files?

* test all the systemd "ctl" apps (as staff_t) by commenting out systemctl_client_subject_type first because that provides a lot of permissions that all have in common.

* do journal clients still need net_admin?

* there might be some redundant net_admins' in there because journal_client_subject_type also has it.

* review pretty much all net_admins everywhere. in a lot of instances it is not really needed.

* implement system_map_t for /boot/System.map.* files?

* implement something somwhat equivalent to genhomedircon

* sshd for guests

* is there a pattern that all nsswitch client subjects want to read machine runtime files?

* implement system_map_t for /boot/System.map.* files?

* vlock

* add systemd units and admins for various systemd daemons i neglected: machine, locale, hostname etc
    the ones that have a ctl app as well as a service unit

* work on localectl loginctl timedatectl hostnamectl

* cover debug-shell.service

* Test it: systemd-notify can be run by system and session scripts (its an applications app) : there are some neat examples in man systemd-notify to test it

* figure out what /run/systemd/inaccessible is for and associate it with a private type

* enable man-db timer on e145

* new "fs" to set up for labeling: nsfs

* appropriately name: audit_test_for_journald() journal_test_for_systemd()

* is there a pattern that all nsswitch client subjects want to read machine runtime files?

* test all the systemd "ctl" apps (as staff_t) by commenting out systemctl_client_subject_type first because that provides a lot of permissions that all have in common.

* do journal clients still need net_admin?

* there might be some redundant net_admins' in there because journal_client_subject_type also has it.

* review pretty much all net_admins everywhere. in a lot of instances it is not really needed.

* implement system_map_t for /boot/System.map.* files?

* Really need file contexts specs for $XDG_RUNTIME_DIR: example systemd socket activated session daemons. these sockets usually located there or /tmp. these
    sockets get created with setsockcreate and setfscreate. If there is no fc spec then they end up wrong

    you can override that with auto object type transitions (like i do now for dbususer sockets in there) but thats unmaintainable
    (well actually its unmaintainable either way)

* maybe create a new type for systemd transient units (they are stored in /run/systemd/system. currently they are treated as normal generic units)
    that means that any process that needs to control transitient units can also control normal generic units. thus that is less than optimal.
    not that many system processes control transient units though. logind is one. systemd_admin also need to be able to do it but he should be already
    able to manage atleast all generic system units anyway (via systemctl domain)
